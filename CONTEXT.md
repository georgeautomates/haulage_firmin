# Firmin — Session Context
_Last updated: 2026-03-25 (session 2 — end of day)_

## What this project is

Python agent for Alan Firmin Ltd (haulage). Polls Gmail for DS Smith booking form emails (PDF attachments), extracts structured order data per job using AI, looks up location point names from Supabase, scores confidence, and writes rows to Google Sheets. Runs in shadow mode alongside the existing n8n workflow for validation.

This is a **multi-client system** — built to scale to other clients who send orders as images, Excel files, or plain email body text. DS Smith (St Regis Fibre A/C) is the first and only client implemented so far.

Reference n8n workflow: `C:\Users\USERAS\Downloads\St Regis Fiber - Shadow Mode.json`

## Current status — PRODUCTION RUNNING ON VPS

The agent is deployed on Hostinger VPS (`72.61.202.184`, Ubuntu 24.04) and running as a systemd service. It starts on boot and restarts on failure.

### What's been completed this session (2026-03-25, session 2)

#### Slack notifications
- `firmin/clients/slack.py` — webhook client using `urllib` (no extra dependencies)
- Batch summary posted after each email: total jobs, GREEN/YELLOW/RED breakdown, per-job line with collection → delivery, price, score
- Comparison report posted on demand via `scripts/slack_comparison_report.py`
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` added to `.env` and `.env.example`
- Webhook: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T0ADXEXQP8W/B0APKMRK8JU/...` (Order Test app)

#### VPS deployment (Hostinger, Ubuntu 24.04)
- Repo pushed to `https://github.com/georgeautomates/haulage_firmin`
- Deployed to `/opt/firmin` via `git clone` + `deploy/setup_vps.sh`
- Python 3.12.3 venv at `/opt/firmin/.venv`
- systemd service `firmin.service` — enabled, starts on boot
- Credentials uploaded via SCP: `.env`, `gmail_token.json`, `gmail_credentials.json`, `service_account.json`

#### Gmail scope fix
- Changed from `gmail.readonly` → `gmail.modify` in both `gmail.py` and `setup_gmail_oauth.py`
- `mark_as_read()` method added to `GmailClient` — called after each email is processed
- Token regenerated with new scope (old token revoked at myaccount.google.com/permissions first)

#### Comparison timer
- systemd timer: `firmin-comparison.timer` + `firmin-comparison.service`
- Runs daily at 8am UK time (BST/GMT auto-handled via `TimeZone=Europe/London`)
- Posts comparison report to Slack
- First run: 2026-03-26 08:00 UTC

#### Deployment workflow (for future updates)
1. Make changes locally
2. `git add . && git commit -m "..." && git push`
3. On VPS: `cd /opt/firmin && git pull && systemctl restart firmin`

### What's been completed in session 1 (2026-03-25)

#### Infrastructure
- Fixed Supabase DSN — old hostname `db.ttwyttggzmgnkgcmrebq.supabase.co` replaced with pooler `aws-1-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com`, username format changed to `postgres.ttwyttggzmgnkgcmrebq`
- Google Cloud project created, Sheets API + Gmail API enabled
- Service account created → `config/service_account.json` → shared with spreadsheet as Editor
- Gmail OAuth credentials → `config/gmail_credentials.json` → token generated at `config/gmail_token.json`
- Gmail OAuth setup script modified to use `open_browser=False` (user pastes URL into correct browser profile)

#### Location matching — 3-tier system (supabase.py)
- **Tier 1 — Known overrides**: postcode → exact Description, defined per client in YAML profile. Bypasses all DB lookups. `ME10 2TD → DS SMITH - SITTINGBOURNE`
- **Tier 2 — Verified cache**: queries `location_mappings` table for previously verified matches (`verified=true`)
- **Tier 3 — Fuzzy search**: `similarity(OrganisationName, org_name) * 0.6 + similarity(full_address, search) * 0.4` — weighted toward org name vs old full_address-only approach
- Cache write: after Tier 3 match, writes unverified row to `location_mappings` for future human review

#### AI prompt fixes (ai.py)
- Added explicit `order_number` rule: "the PO number starting with PO-"
- Added `customer_ref` clarification: "line AFTER the PO number"
- Strengthened address separation rules to reduce collection/delivery text bleed

#### Client profile fixes (st_regis_fibre.yaml)
- `spaces` corrected from `0` to `26` (matches Proteo/n8n)
- `known_locations`: `ME10 2TD → DS SMITH - SITTINGBOURNE` (confirmed as most common Proteo delivery point, 173/459 entries)

#### Dedup fix (dedup.py)
- Fixed in-memory SQLite mode (`:memory:`) — now holds a persistent connection so tables survive between calls

#### End-to-end validated
- Single job `2560920` written to sheet matches Proteo TMS entries exactly:
  - collection_point: `Data Solutions Ltd - Dartford` ✓
  - delivery_point: `DS SMITH - SITTINGBOURNE` ✓
  - rate: `£300.00` ✓, pallets: `26` ✓, spaces: `26` ✓
  - score: `100 GREEN` ✓

#### Agent run
- `python -m firmin.agent` run successfully — processed all unread DS Smith emails in inbox
- SQLite dedup (`firmin.db`) prevents reprocessing on subsequent runs

#### Comparison script (run_comparison.py)
- Reads Actual Entry + Verification tabs, joins on `delivery_order_number`
- Compares: `collection_point`, `delivery_point`, `price`, `order_number` (scored)
- Also shows: `collection_date`, `delivery_date` (info only — PDF dates ≠ actual execution dates)
- Normalisation handles: date format `19/03/26` → `19/03/2026`, price `£300.00` → `300`, order number PO prefix before `/`, case, whitespace
- Kemsley delivery point aliases normalised to single value for matching
- Results written to Comparison tab

#### Comparison results (136 matched jobs)
| Field | Match rate |
|-------|-----------|
| collection_point | 85.3% |
| price | 91.2% |
| delivery_date | 80.9% (info only) |
| collection_date | 77.9% (info only) |
| order_number | 72.8% |
| delivery_point | 73.5% |
| **Overall FULL match** | **40.4%** |

Known mismatches:
- `delivery_point`: 20x `DS SMITH - SITTINGBOURNE` vs `Kemsley Depot (DSSR) - Sittingbourne` — Proteo staff use both interchangeably, normalised as aliases in comparison
- `collection_point`: some wrong fuzzy matches (Woodgreen→Chas Storer, Morrison→Swan Valley) — location DB has duplicate/variant entries
- `order_number`: some Proteo entries use internal reference format `1840071/1478384` instead of PO number — not fixable from PDF data
- Dates off by 1 day — PDF = requested date, Proteo = actual execution date — structural, not a bug

## Supabase

**Connection:** `postgresql://postgres.ttwyttggzmgnkgcmrebq:***@aws-1-eu-west-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`

**Tables used:**
- `"Location Points"` — 159,421 rows. Columns: `"Description"`, `"OrganisationName"`, `"PostCode"`, `full_address`. Used for location matching.
- `location_mappings` — learned cache. Columns: `id`, `pdf_address`, `postcode`, `matched_description`, `verified`, `client_name`, `created_at`. No unique constraint — insert uses NOT EXISTS guard.
- `customer_profiles` — not yet used in code

**Key Supabase findings:**
- `ME10 2TD` (Kemsley Mill) has hundreds of rows — unusable with postcode-only filter
- `OrganisationName` column always populated — better similarity target than `full_address`
- `pg_trgm` extension enabled (required for `similarity()`)

---

## Google Sheets

**Spreadsheet ID:** `1uEst-r23EiTyfdmL6gx_YQMuzR0s7yyx-qJVLIUyDSI`

**Tabs:**
- `Actual Entry` — agent output (428+ rows as of 2026-03-25)
- `Verification` — Proteo TMS actual entries scraped by Playwright RPA (459 rows)
- `Comparison` — comparison results written by run_comparison.py

**Column notes:**
- ` goods_type` has a **leading space** in the column name — must match exactly
- `delivery_order_number` = job number — join key for comparison

---

## .env

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=set ✓
AI_EXTRACTION_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
SUPABASE_POSTGRES_DSN=set ✓ (pooler endpoint)
GMAIL_TOKEN_PATH=config/gmail_token.json ✓
GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=config/gmail_credentials.json ✓
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=config/service_account.json ✓
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=set ✓
POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

## Key facts

- PDF: 3 jobs per page, up to 48 jobs per email, one AI call per job
- Gmail filter: `subject:@dssmith.com is:unread has:attachment`
- Dedup: SQLite `firmin.db` — tracks processed email message_ids and job numbers
- Confidence scoring: GREEN ≥80, YELLOW ≥50, RED <50 (per st_regis_fibre.yaml thresholds)
- AI model: direct OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`), model `gpt-4o-mini`
- Collection times in PDF = requested time, not actual — will always differ from Proteo
- Dates in PDF = booking date, not execution date — typically 1 day earlier than Proteo

## What's NOT done yet

- **Production scheduling** — ✅ DONE. Running as systemd service on Hostinger VPS.
- **Slack notifications** — ✅ DONE. Batch summary per email + on-demand comparison report.
- **Comparison scheduling** — ✅ DONE. systemd timer runs daily at 8am UK time (BST), posts to Slack.
- **Multi-client expansion** — image, Excel, email body input types not built
- **Playwright RPA auto-entry** — GREEN orders not yet auto-submitted to Proteo TMS
- **Verification scrape** — Playwright scrape of Proteo back into Verification tab (currently manual/separate process)
- **`customer_profiles` Supabase table** — defined in spec but not used in code yet
- **`location_mappings` human review UI** — unverified cache entries accumulate but no workflow to review/verify them

## Known challenges & gotchas

### VPS deployment
- `.env` must be uploaded manually via SCP — it is gitignored and never in the repo
- Gmail token (`gmail_token.json`) must also be uploaded manually — it is gitignored
- If the Gmail token expires or is revoked: delete it locally, run `python scripts/setup_gmail_oauth.py` (paste URL into correct browser profile), re-upload via SCP, restart service
- Gmail scope must be `gmail.modify` (not `readonly`) — token must be regenerated if scope changes
- VPS `.env` previously got overwritten with `.env.example` template during SCP — always verify with `grep OPENAI /opt/firmin/.env` after uploading

### Dedup / reprocessing
- If the agent fails mid-run (e.g. 401 AI errors), emails get marked as seen in dedup but nothing is written to the sheet
- To reprocess: `sqlite3 /opt/firmin/firmin.db "DELETE FROM processed_emails; DELETE FROM processed_orders;"`
- Gmail backlog: 50 emails were processed with errors before the API key was correctly set — these are now marked as read in Gmail and in dedup, and are gone from the backlog

### Gmail query
- Query: `subject:@dssmith.com is:unread has:attachment`
- DS Smith emails are **forwarded**, so the sender domain `@dssmith.com` appears in the subject line, not the From field
- PDF filenames are `GRIGGS_Q...` — this is Alan Firmin's internal reference name for DS Smith jobs, not a different client

### Slack
- Webhook URL is in `.env` as `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
- If not set, Slack notifications are silently skipped (no error)
- Comparison report requires Verification tab to have data — if empty, reports 0 matched jobs

### Kemsley Depot collection issue (open)
- When PDF has `KEMSLEY DEPOT / DS SMITH RECYCLING / ME10 2TD` as the **collection** address, it matches `DS SMITH - SITTINGBOURNE` — wrong when Kemsley is collection not delivery
- Needs discussion with George to determine correct behaviour
- Comparison report data will help quantify the impact
